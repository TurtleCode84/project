## What is TrackTask?
TrackTask is a Shareable Task Management system. Users can create tasks with names, descriptions, due dates, etc. and keep track of their completion & priority.
Additionally, tasks can be (potentially must be) grouped in collections, which can be shared with other users and edited by them if they have the right permissions. [Learn more](https://tracktask.eu.org/about)

## Where is it?
TrackTask lives at the following domains:
<br>https://tracktask.eu.org (production, `main`)

## Things to consider:
- This project is still in development, some things may be incomplete or not work as expected. We're working on adding the rest of the main structure, but most of us have other commitments such as school, so we can't always devote our attention to this project.
- If you find something that you really dislike and think could be a lot better, please don't just tell us that it could be better. Sometimes we miss things, but other times we'd like to know _how_ we can make things good, so just complaining about it won't get us anywhere.
