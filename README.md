# Welcome to TrackTask!
If you're here, you're probably a member of TrackTask's development team! ~~(if not, get out of here you hacker)~~
<br>Thanks for joining, every bit of help counts!

<hr>

# Next Big Goal:
- [ ] Complete the TrackTask framework to the point where we can actually use TrackTask to track what we still need to work on (lol)
<hr>

## What is TrackTask?
TrackTask is a Shareable Task Management system. Users can create tasks with names, descriptions, due dates, etc. and keep track of their completion & priority.
Additionally, tasks can be (potentially must be) grouped in collections, which can be shared with other users and edited by them if they have the right permissions.
I think it's pretty cool, otherwise I wouldn't have started making it... :P

## Where is it?
TrackTask lives at the following Vercel domains:
<br>https://tracktask.vercel.app (production)
<br>https://beta-tracktask.vercel.app (beta, currently a redirect to `dev`)
<br>https://dev-tracktask.vercel.app (development)

## What's built so far?
Glad you asked! Here's a running features list:
- [x] Login/Signup
- [x] Admin/Banned/Verified Roles
- [x] Admin panel w/ full ability to edit users and access to some recent stats
- [x] Tasks (very basic, you can only add tasks at the moment and there are some timezone bugs to work out)
- [x] IP banning and blacklisted usernames/emails (through Vercel dashboard)
- [ ] About/FAQ (in progress, not complete)
- [ ] Individual task UI (`/tasks/{id}`)
- [ ] Collections
- [ ] Reporting for admin attention (tasks, users, collections)
<br>... and more to come!

## What do I do?
### Project Manager:
Manage the project :P

### Security Analyst:
Thoroughly review and test the site & API code and UI for any holes in the structure, including code inconsistency, unhandled errors/scenarios, unsecured endpoints, etc.

### Logo Maker:
Design a logo and favicon for TrackTask, preferrably one that's easy to integrate into the existing site.

### Site Admin:
Moderate the website & user activity, handle abuse reports, and inform the Project Manager of large-scale attacks or abuse.

### UI/Style Expert:
Working with the existing site framework, redesign and restructure to make TrackTask more user-friendly and look better.

### Testers:
Try everything in every way possible, create issues in this repository as you find bugs or problems, attempt to hack things so we can fix them, **report Javascript console errors**.

## Things to consider:
- This is a DEVELOPMENT project, things are going to be incomplete. I'm working on adding all of the main structure, but I'm legally required to go to school, so I can't work on this 24/7 (just 23/7).
- If it seems like I'm shooting down your ideas, I'm sorry, I'm literally writing this on a 3-hour bus ride after a cross-country meet, but some of my responses are via email and can't have as much detail or constructive feedback as they should.
- That being said, I'm not on the computer _all_ the time, so there is a delay in my responses.
- I'm a high schooler, not a professional web developer. Yet.

## By accepting the invite for and contributing to this GitHub repository, you agree to all Contributor and Site Admin Rules, as applicable.

## Contributor Rules:
1. **Never** edit the `main` branch directly!
2. Try to leave a brief description when you make a commit, it's okay if you forget occasionally but it helps everyone else know what you changed. I repeatedly ignore this rule, so don't worry too much about it.
3. The `dev` branch is the main branch for testing, but to prevent confusion only one contributor or group of contributors should work on it at a time. If you need your own branch with a deployment preview to test something, please contact the Project Manager.
<br>***Tip:** You can create your own branch and open a pull request for it, this will automatically create a preview deployment for you to inspect your changes.*
4. Collaborate! Ask for help if you need it, opinions are readily available!
5. This repository is private, and TrackTask is **closed-source**. This may change later on in development, but for the time being **what's in the repo should stay in the repo**. No stealing code or sharing anything, please.
6. By contributing to this repository, you release your committed code to TrackTask and the Project Manager. You must be credited for any contributions that are merged into the `main` branch, but once you contribute code it may not be taken back except for copyright reasons or PII.

## Site Admin Rules:
1. **Please no admin panel screenshots :/**
2. Don't be a jerk, admin tools aren't for taking out your wrath on random people.
3. Account details (here meaning any information, full or partial, that is stored in the database about any given user) should only be discussed with the account owner, including but not limited to ban details, suspected account compromises, password changes, warnings, verification, and others.
4. For non-private conversations or if no email is provided for a user, [wasteof.money](https://wasteof.money) is an acceptable form of communication. Email should be used for most conversations, but we're still working out whether or not a shared account will be necessary.
5. Tasks and collections should be treated as **private information**.
6. Keep your account secure, admin accounts have the potential to wreak havoc in the wrong hands.
